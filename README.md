1. An asteroid is a minor planet of the inner Solar System . They are metallic or rocky bodies without atmospheres. The size and shapes of asteroids vary significantly    including even dwarf planets but not planets . The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of Marsand Jupiter, generally in      relatively low-eccentricity(i.e. not very elongated) orbits. Near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of Earth.            Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known asEarth-crossers. As of April 2022, 28,772 near-Earth asteroids are known; 878 have a diameter of one      kilometer or larger.There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits crossEarth's, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth.If a        rocky meteoroid larger than 25 meters but smaller than one kilometer (a little more than 1/2 mile) were to hit Earth, it would likely cause local damage to the 
   impact area. We believe anything larger thanone to two kilometer(one kilometer is a little more than one-half mile) could have worldwide effects. Calculating          diameter of a Asteroid is a complex task and inthis casestudies I will try to predict the diameter of as asteroid . Knowing diameter of anasteroid will help us to      make proactive decision to tackle asteroids there are many asteroids deflection strategies either we can change path of the asteroids or make it collide with some      projectile from earth to destroy it outside earth only.

2. I am using a dataset which is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter) this data is obtained by    a user Victor Basu from https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi. 

3. I started with basic data cleaning followed by Exploratory Data Analysis . Moving forward i did advance data cleaning and data preprocessing , I experimented with      different machine learning models and got R1 score 0.98 on my test dataset for linear regression model .
